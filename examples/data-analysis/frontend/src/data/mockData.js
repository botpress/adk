Your kind words regarding our facilities and staff are immensely appreciated. We're delighted that you found our location convenient and easily accessible to public transportation.

In regard to your experience with the pool, it's important to clarify that we indeed have an adults-only pool, but this is only one of three pools available on our property. We understand that families like yours would love to enjoy pool time together and we happily accommodate this at our other two pools. We apologize if this was not made clear during your stay.

We're looking forward to having you and your family back with us in the future for a more comprehensive experience.

Best regards,
Tobi from JIXU`,
